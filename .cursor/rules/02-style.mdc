# Code & Documentation Style

• Use explicit, typed interfaces everywhere. Prefer **Pydantic v2** models; fallback to `dataclasses` if there is zero validation demand.

• Each new file must start with a 1-to-3-line docstring that answers _what_ & _why_.

• Auto-generated code must include the banner:

```python
# AUTO-GENERATED – DO NOT EDIT BY HAND
```

• Formatters & linters: **Black**, **Ruff**, and **pre-commit** hooks are mandatory. Max line length: 100 chars.

• Mermaid diagrams: wrap all labels in double quotes and break lines with `<br/>` (Cursor rendering requirement).

• Prefer pure functions. Side effects (I/O, network, DB) live in `infra/` or `services/` modules.
