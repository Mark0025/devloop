# Prompt Conventions

• **Planning** prompts must start with the header:

```
PLAN:
```

• **Implementation** prompts must start with the header:

```
APPLY:
```

• The agent may ask up to **three** clarifying questions per PLAN cycle.

• Before proposing a brand-new file, always run a semantic codebase search to ensure it doesn’t already exist in another form.
