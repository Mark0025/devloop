# Memory Governance

• **Create** memories only for long-lived user preferences or the _locations_ of secrets (never the secret values themselves).

• **Delete** memories immediately when the user contradicts or rescinds a preference.

• Never store transient, project-specific TODOs or meeting notes as memory; those belong in the repo issue tracker.

• Use concise, descriptive titles so memories are uniquely identifiable.
